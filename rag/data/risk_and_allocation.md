# Understanding Risk and Asset Allocation

Risk is the potential for an investment's actual returns to differ from
expected returns.

## Types of Investment Risks

-   **Market Risk:** Overall market movements affect performance.
-   **Credit Risk:** Borrowers may fail to repay debts.
-   **Liquidity Risk:** Difficulty selling an asset quickly.
-   **Inflation Risk:** Purchasing power erosion over time.

## Asset Allocation Strategy

Asset allocation is the most important determinant of portfolio
performance. It involves balancing risk and reward by adjusting the
percentage of each asset in a portfolio based on the investor's:

-   Goals
-   Risk tolerance
-   Time horizon

### Formula (simplified):

    Allocation = (Risk tolerance × Time horizon) ÷ Market volatility
